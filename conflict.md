    Beef patty (added by Peter)
    Bottom bun

Peter's branch ingredients file:
    Top bun

1. We reviewed the ingredients in Peter's and Stan's ingredients file and agreed upon the best order in the burger.

2. Then we merged Stan's pull request first as there was no conflict with the main branch.

3. Finally we resolved the conflict in Peter's pull request by arranging the ingredients as agreeded upon then accepted the merge with main.
